# Repository Description

This GitHub repository contains two mathematical modeling projects: "SEASONAL TIME SHIFT AND OPTIMUM TIME ZONE" discussing the efficacy of daylight saving time, and "APS: An Automatic Parking System for autonomous vehicles," detailing a mathematically modeled parking solution for autonomous cars. Both projects were awarded with Honors.

## SEASONAL TIME SHIFT AND OPTIMUM TIME ZONE
In this project, we explore whether daylight saving time provides real benefits and which time setting (summer or winter) might be optimal. This experiment was conducted in the first week of the course without prior knowledge in modeling to gauge our initial capabilities. This work received the highest distinction.

## APS: An Automatic Parking System for Autonomous Vehicles
This model represents a theoretical framework for an automatic parking system for autonomous vehicles. The project spanned two months and was a collaborative effort. My role primarily involved calculating the mathematical aspects of vehicle maneuvers and contributing to other project areas. This project also received the highest honors.
